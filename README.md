# Uncertainty Dashboard

Our visualization proposes a reusable representation of prediction systems to guide decision makers to understand the implicit *uncertainty* that is present on *machine-learning* prediction systems.

In particular, for our case of study (*Academic Risk based on Historical Data)*. There are three main sources of *uncertainty*, the
**prediction model**, the **data consistency** and the **case completeness** of the historic dataset. **Uncertainty Dashboard** is a proposed visualization technique where the risk to fail in an academic semester is predicted by the machine learning algorithm and is  presented to the users (professors and academics) in a straightforward way, so they can make an informed decision about the optimal student's academic load.
