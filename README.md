# UncertaintyDashboard

Our visualization proposes a generic representation of prediction systems using WebComponents to guide decision makers to understand the implicit uncertainty that is present among machine-learning prediction systems.

In particular, for our case of study (Academic risk based on historical data). There are three main sources of uncertainty, the prediction model, the data consistency and the case completeness of the historic dataset. Uncertainty Dashboard is a proposed visualization technique,  where the risk to fail in an academic semester is predicted by the machine learning algorithm and is  presented to the users (Professors and academics).
